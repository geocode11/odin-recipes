    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, <em><u>divided</u></em></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together warm water, yeast, and brown sugar in a large mixing
            bowl; let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix in 2 1/2 cups flour until
            incorporated. Turn dough out onto a
            clean, floured surface. Knead dough, adding remaining flour, a
            little at a time, until dough is no longer
            sticky. Place dough into an oiled bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Punch down dough and form it into a tight ball. Allow dough to relax
            for 1 minute before rolling out.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>If baking dough on a pizza stone, place toppings on dough and bake
            immediately. If baking dough on a pan,
            lightly oil the pan and let dough rise for 15 to 20 minutes before
            topping and baking it.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is
            golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
